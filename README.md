I'm a Data Engineer at Shopify who loves to learn new things

Bear in mind, I am terrible at puns, so I got ChatGPT to write a few for your enjoyment for getting this far:

- Just a **panda**mic problem solver trying to **bear** the load of these bug fixes.
- Donâ€™t let the complexity **grizzly** you, just break down the problem, **beary** carefully.
- **Paws** for a moment and consider the **bear** necessities of clean code.
- I told my computer to **bear** with me while I make these arrays align, but it just **growled** in response.
- Sometimes when debugging, you have to go on a **bear** hunt to find the elusive bug.
- Un**bear**able error messages make me want to hibernate until spring.
- When you finally fix that bug, it's like finding a **honey** pot at the end of a **beary** long day.
- In the forest of programming, sometimes you need to **paws** and enjoy the trees structure.
- Always **bear** in mind that every problem has a solution, you just need to **claw** your way through it.

Remember, coding can be a **beary** challenging task, but a little humor makes it all more **bearable**!
